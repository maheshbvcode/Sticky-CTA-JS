<p>  The sticky cart element is initially invisible. When the add-to-cart button is scrolled out of the viewport, the sticky cart element is shown. When the add-to-cart button is scrolled back into the viewport, the sticky cart element is hidden.</p>

<p>The code also adds an event listener to the add-to-cart button. When the button is clicked, the product is added to the cart. The cart count is also updated.</p>
